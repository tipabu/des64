self_test
  Series of tests to ensure the reversibility of the algorithms.
  The DES self test and CBC validate against known plaintexts.
  Note that the DES self test requires that the parity check be disabled.
test_batch
  Takes key, plaintext, ciphertext sets from stdin (or files listed on the commandline) in hex.
  Several sample files are given in the test/ directory, taken from
